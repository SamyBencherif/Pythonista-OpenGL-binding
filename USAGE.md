Installation note
=================

Installation has not been tested for this package, though it might be similar to that of its predecessor, which was to copy relevant files into site-packages (scene.py, _scene.py). This would surely work for some features, but I am not sure how to make the Media folder containing all of Pythonista's images and sounds available to the installed module.

Usage
=====

For now, simply place a project you would like to test out in the same folder as scene.py. Tester.py is a working example. Run it with:

```
python tester.py
```


Requires Pyglet. Tested with Python 3 on Mac.
